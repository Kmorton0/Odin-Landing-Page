# Odin-Landing-Page
For this project, we will be creating an entire webpage from a design The Odin Project has provided for us. The design that will be provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors that's been used in previous exercises.
At this point it is not expected to have everything memorized. There are also a few small details that may not have been encountered in our lessons yet (by design).
The goal is to get our project as close as we can to the design, so do not worry about getting the exact margins/pixles correct.The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. EX: It doesnt matter if you use "margin: 24px" when the design actually has "margin: 48px".
Finally, feel free to substitute your own content into this design. The images have some meaningless dummy content, but if you want to make up a business and personalize this page, please feel free to do so! Insert actual images in the placeholders, and feel free to play with the colors and fonts a bit too. Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash are all great sites to use to grab free-to-use images.
